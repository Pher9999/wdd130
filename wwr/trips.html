                        <li><b>Secluded Campsites:</b> Most trips utilize remote riverside beaches or forest clearings
                            that are inaccessible by car, offering deep immersion in nature. </li>
                        <li><b>Riverside Dining:</b> Guides often prepare gourmet meals, such as dutch-oven dinners and
                            hearty breakfasts, served by a campfire. </li>
                        <li><b>Wilderness Connection:</b> Evenings are spent around a campfire, sharing stories and
                            stargazing in areas with zero light pollution. </li>
                        <li><b>Amenities:</b> Depending on the outfitter, gear like tents, thick sleeping pads, and dry
                            bags for your belongings are typically provided. </li>

                            water. </li>
                        <li><b>Self-Reflection:</b> The river provides a "serene space for personal growth," allowing
                            you to disconnect from daily noise and reconnect with yourself. </li>
                        <li><b>No Planning Hassles:</b> Choosing a guided trip means you don't have to coordinate

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Close-Up Exploration:</b> The raft's shallow draft allows it to get extremely close to
                            shorelines, hidden coves, volcanic sea caves, and towering waterfalls that larger cruise
                            ships cannot reach.</li>
                        <li><b>Wildlife Sightings:</b> These trips are prime for spotting marine and coastal wildlife,
                            including humpback whales, orcas, sea otters, seals, bald eagles, and sometimes bears or
                            mountain goats.</li>
                        <li><b>Guided Insight:</b> A naturalist or knowledgeable captain typically provides a narrative
                            on local history, geology, and the importance of the waterways to indigenous peoples. </li>
                        <li><b>Participation Requirements:</b><br>
                            <b>Age/Height:</b> Usually a minimum age of 10 years and a minimum height of 4 feet.<br>
                            <b>Physicality:</b> Participants must be able to step in and out of the raft. The ride is
                            bumpy and
                            jarring, so it is generally not recommended for those with back, neck, or joint issues, or
                            those who are pregnant.

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>The Thrill of the Rapids:</b> You will work as a team under the guidance of a
                            professional to navigate various "Classes" of water. These range from Class I (calm,
                            fast-moving water) to Class V (technical, powerful
                            rapids).</li>
                        <li><b>Immersive Nature:</b> Trips often pass through deep canyons and diverse ecosystems
                            inaccessible by land. You might see towering sandstone cliffs, ancient petroglyphs, and
                            wildlife like bald eagles, bighorn sheep, or river otters.</li>
                        <li><b>Half-Day/Full-Day Trips:</b> Ideal for beginners or those short on time. These often
                            include a few hours of paddling, safety briefings, and sometimes a riverside BBQ lunch.</li>
                        <li><b>Multi-Day Expeditions:</b> For a deeper escape, multi-day trips (3–15 days) involve
                            camping on sandy beaches under the stars, gourmet riverside meals, and hiking to hidden
                            waterfalls.</li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>The Float:</b> Most trips last between 90 minutes and 4 hours, depending on the river’s
                            flow and your selected route.</li>
                        <li><b>Difficulty:</b> Standard tubing occurs on Class I "lazy rivers" with calm water and
                            occasional gentle ripples. </li>
                        <li><b>Safety & Swimming:</b> Because there is no guide in your tube, the ability to swim is
                            often mandatory as there is a high probability of entering the water during the run. </li>
                        <li><b>Self-Guided Freedom:</b> You can often "captain your own boat," allowing you to take on
                            the rapids at your own pace while enjoying scenic river views. </li>
                        <li><b>Activities:</b> Beyond floating, many trips include designated spots for swimming, rock
                            jumping, or stopping on river
                            islands for a picnic.</li>
